> Having not had any breakfast, you are quite hungry, so testing the toaster

> seconds later, out pops the most perfectly done toast with just the right
> amount of butter and jam. Wow that is good! You spend a while longer
> testing the toaster again and again "just to be sure". After you are
> stuffed on toast, you start to wonder how this will help you with the
> dragon.

> After thinking about it a bit, you decide that Denevieve is probably a

> 
> After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
> threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
> tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
> trusted with a quest about dragons.
> 
> The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
> take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
> list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon.
